### Question

How easily could someone inside your network get access to the traffic between your services?

### Answer

In general, for most medium-sized enterprises the topology of the internal network is pretty much complicated these days, and the network is often divided into many subnets with different ACLs to describe the subdomains. Considering the complexity and the cost to configure the network, it's difficult to apply network security functions to the internal network. In most cases, the security inside the boundary is based on the assumption of internal network is secure enough. It doesn't mean the network security is not important (refer to Defense in depth), it is more convenient and easier to protect the communications between our own services, with less cost in most cases by the way.

There are a lot of ways to access your traffic, sniff on the key nodes in critical path, using the ARP deception, DNS pollution, or just steal your code - it's easier to get codes in the internal network, after analyzing it's possible to get many sensitive information like credentials of API keys, then the attackers could retrieve business data or access the database.

You could apply the full path HTTPS with correct TLS/SSL configuration as well, introduce some security configurations to apply resource control, and consider how to protect the codes and configuration, on allow the related people to touch.

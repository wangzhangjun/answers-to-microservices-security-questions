### Question

How easily could someone inside your network get access to the traffic between your services?

### Answer

In general, for most medium-size enterprise the topology of the internal network is pretty much complicated these days, the network is divided in many subnets with different ALCs to describe the sub-domain often.  Considering the complexity and the cost to configure the network, it's hard to apply network security functions on the internal network, is most case the security inside the boundary bases on the assumption of internal network is secure enough.  It doesn't mean network security is not important (refer to Defense in depth), it is more convenient and easier to protect the communications between our own services, with less cost in most cases by the way.

There are a lot of methods to access your traffic, sniff on the key node in critical path, use ARP cheating, DNS polluting, os just steal your code - it's easier to get code in internal network, after analyzing it's possible to get many sensible information like credentials of API keys, then the attackers could retrieve business data or access the database.

You could apply full path HTTPS with correct TLS/SSL configuration as well, introduce some security configuration to apply resource control, and consider how to protect the code and configuration, on allow the related people to touch.

### Question

What guarantees do you have that a request received from an authenticated user hasnâ€™t been tampered with?

### Answer

I think the simplest solution is use SSL for the full path, as we know SSL/TLS is designed to be tamper proof, as the specification, the transport includes a message integrity check using a keyed MAC.  Of course man-in-the-middle attacher can catch the encrypted packet, but no way to decrypt, and thanks the unique encyption key, the attacker can't inject this packet into another connection.

We use SSL/TLS in default, but should aware this just protect the connection, and the hardest part is the certificate management, because in microservice scenario, hunderd endpoints require certificate.

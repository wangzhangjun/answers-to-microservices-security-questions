### Question

Are you familiar with all the other types of injection, and how to protect against them?

### Answer

Injection attack means the attacker supplies untrusted input, the program process these as commands or operations in execution and return unexpected result, SQL Injection is mostly known injection and often happens if the developer just embeds user's input into SQL statement.  But today if you use technology like prepared-statement or ORM, SQL injection is not a problem.

But we should take care of the injection in other places if we are embedding something from user, for example we use string.format to build XML or JSON, and the placeholder will be replaced by user's input, that will be a chance to inject.  Some script languages have risk of injection if you are careless, in Ruby and JavaScript method eval is dangerous becuase it has ability to execute any expressions.  It's not hard to get rid of injection risk, check everywhere if you are embedding user's input and review the usage of your direct dynamic code evaluation things.

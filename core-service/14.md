### Question

Are you up to speed with the state of the art in password storage?

### Answer

If you are running a website which serves more than 1 million users, the password storage is important and you can't just let developer puts some salts and hash the plaintext in careless.  Although we have some cryptography knowledge from books, it's not safe to write our own code to encrypt the password, you can find a lot of crypto tools in any languages to solve this gracefully, don't repeat yourself especially in cryptography.

It's time to review your current password protection, our goal is simple, we don't want the attacker could access the password storage, even the passwords are leaked in a breach, we don't want the plaintext goes wild.  Try to avoid using short salt, reuse salt, do the hash in client side and use secure random to generate salts, you could also follow the fashion like using slow hash functions or some hardware security module products.

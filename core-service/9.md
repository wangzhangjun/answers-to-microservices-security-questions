### Question

If an attacker owned a service, could they pretty easily request anything from its downstream services?

### Answer

Obviously, we can't let the attacker do this, but the problem is how.  Let's assume this bad guy has private key and access your server, and he may use some HTTP client try to create request to your downstream, he may know the API endpoint and the contract, at least in network layer he could send HTTP request to destination, but the last defense still protects us, he must have authorization and it's not possible to forge one.

In token based auth/authz mode, the identity provider is the only service to issue token which contains credentials of privileges, the rest services could only verify these tokens, they are all consumers, if they want to request the downstream, just forward the token, most time the token validation doesn't need a central service.  This pattern is common in the microservice world, it makes the services consistent and keeps independence.  That's why sidecar is important, it wraps the common requirements and transparent to service.

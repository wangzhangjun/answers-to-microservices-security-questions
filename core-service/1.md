### Question

Are you just protecting your system at the Internet boundary?

### Answer

In most enterprise's practice, keep everything in a boundary and assume that is safe is outdated.  The drawbridge for the castle is same as the firewall for our internal network and most time it doesn't work well for a ninja.  If someone breaks into your internal network, you will lose everything basically.  In past we assume the internal network is safe, which contains a lot of heavy services and resources, they don't have constraint with least privilege and most of them share the credentials, things could be worse if someone hijacks a server and he just wants to steal your most important assert - data and leave quietly, nobody knows.

The good news is in modern days, we don't believe a firewall or a gateway (drawbridge) based on 4 layer network is secure enough and it's a time to review your internal network settings and the security mechanism in instance level and application level. In microservice scope, system breaks into single responsibility services and each service manage the own resources, obviously the attack surface is wider than monolithic, and you must consider how to monitor these services are safe.  Basically, our system is deployed in the cloud, the platform build-in security function is important to use, and an application level is based on your own implementation.

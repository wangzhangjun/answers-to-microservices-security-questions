### Question

Do your services let their callers access all the APIs that a service offers, or just the ones it needs to fulfil its function?

### Answer

That's an authorization question, authorization often describes the client has permission to specified resources from the resource owner, and resource owner should have capability to verify.  In RBAC pattern, we could assign a role to the caller and each role contains business scope and attaches with some privileges, then in application level we could have a facade to apply verification for each endpoint.  You could also refer to the scope design of OAuth2, it's a good example to describe the business domains inside of the whole system.

In microservice, we often emphasize the boundary of each service, the boundary supplies isolation in native and covers the details inside, it's helpful to define the business scope and bind authorization.  For each service, you just need to check the authorization of each request, and we can implement this part in sidecar.

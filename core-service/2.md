### Question

What protections do you have in place if an intruder gets inside your core network?

### Answer

The problem we are facing is the attacker break into the perimeter, the resources inside the internal network are easy to access.Therefore the common solution is setup different protection in different layers inside the perimeter, and for the instances and databases, we should put them into different subnet with explicit access control rules to avoid misconfiguration.

Consider to apply this security model, we should distinguish the layers or attach surfaces at beginning.  We could start from bottom layer network, for most cloud environment is VPC and subnet setting, you also need some instance endpoint security suites to ensure the instances and resources are safe.  The top level is the applications, the security methods should be found in AppSec (like OWSAP Top 10).  It's not enough to just protect, monitor alarms and action tracing are essential, also it's better to have security audit.  In microservice boundary, we are going to manage hundred endpoints and instances, avoid manually control and monitor is the most challenging part.

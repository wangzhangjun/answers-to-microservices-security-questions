### Question

Do your services trust each other too much? Orâ€¦ Do your services trust whoever is calling them too much? (Are you sure only your services can call into your services?)

### Answer

I have to say in some microservice practices, people often ignore this question, they have many reasons: the assumption of inside the boundary is safe enough, hard to implement in the private cloud, just no risk awareness or we don't have time.  So we are facing the problem what is you know the DNS name (internal DNS for service discovery is common today), you can invoke any services inside the boundary, or push any data into the middleware, which we should avoid that in microservices world, we can't just use a huge firewall to protect everything inside of the perimeter like the old days.

To resolve this problem we have different methods at different levels, set the network ACL with different services, use a client certificate to trust the client, you can also use some platform building security methods.  We tried to use AWS security group to force the clients, we also used client certificate, in our experience, whatever the method is, first you must have one, second is how to manage them automatically, config as code, enough security audit and alarms are necessary too, because you can't do that one by one, especially you are facing hundreds of containers, and we should have some tools to notice you the certs are going to expire!

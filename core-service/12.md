### Question

Everyone knows about SQL injection, right? But what measures do you have in place to ensure no one writes code thatâ€™s vulnerable to SQL injection?

### Answer

There are a lot of preventions to SQL injection in different levels, although we could avoid most vulnerabilities in implementation, it depends on people who write the code and someone review that then point out the problem, it's not enough the assume safety based on human actions, we should introduce some automatic processors as we deal with the unit test, coverage or dependency check.

Burp is a tool to help you detect the SQL injection automatically, which you can embed that into your build pipeline, run the test suites after you deployed service in some staging environment.  There are a lot of choices about the security auto test products, like Burp and ZAP, but you must be clear about that, it's not 100% accuracy about the result, get rid of the other mechanisms is not acceptable.

Another thought is introducing database firewall to monitor SQL queries, you could do that in a strict way with a whitelist.  It's easier in microservices, we split the huge database into a lot of small ones, each database should concentrate to business in the domain, so not too many queries in your whitelist.

### Question

What logging do you have in place that you can use to detect and analyse security breaches?

### Answer

In microservices, we often have a log center to collect logs from everywhere, instances, containers, proxies, middlewares, we have a lot of metrics and a big data system to monitor, analyze and fire alarms.  For us, just reconsider which metrics are security related, we could arrange a table which describes the source and content of the log, from endpoint security software report to firewall traffic.  I strongly recommend to sperate the metrics out of the logging system, metrics in different scenarios represent different meaning, we can use access log to check the throughput of the system, also we could monitor the business growth, and you can also use it to send alarm if there is a brute force attack.

You also need software to manage the vulnerabilities, and that could be a part of your security platform, we want a system to tracing vulnerability status, missing software updates and expired certificate, the platform could have a dashboard and connect every security factors in the system, and it's decoupled to the other services.

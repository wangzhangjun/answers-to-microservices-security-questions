### Question

Does the identity of the person who originated each call at the client get passed into your internal services, or is that lost at the gateway?

### Answer

This question describes a common case in microservice practice, for now we have a lot of products of API Gateway, they always verify each request then forward to internal service, which we often deploy that at the edge of our network boundary, it works well if we assume everything is safe in internal network - which is insufficient to current security requirement.

Forward the identity and implement the distribution verification is one of the solution, image you have a proxy for each service to verify the token from HTTP request returns 401 if validate fails, and forward that to service behind, for the service behind you just need to get user's id from proxy and fetch data belongs to the user (Business Concentrate).  This scenario is we recommended and often implement that in the sidecar, this pattern is more popular these days - not just the security reason - could be found in Service Mesh products now.

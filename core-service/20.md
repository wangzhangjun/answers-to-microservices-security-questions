### Question

Do you know what a Hardware Security Module (HSM) is, and when and how to make use of one?

### Answer

In cryptography, as the `Kerckhoffs's principle`: A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.  We don't explain this principle to much here, just consider the TLS, the algorithms are open to the world (although is hard to test the crypto algorithm) but without the key, you can't get the information in the communication.  Keep the secrets is the significant barrier to security, so we have a lot of practice about Key Management.

You may familiar with Java's Keystore, as the other Java components, you've saved your keys to a file and have a password to protect it, have you ever consider if someone breaks into your instance and steals that?  Most times the password of keystore is a config in plaintext and embed in build artifact.  HSM could handle the secret protection in hardware level, if we want to avoid attacker dump the memory to get secret out HSM also has abilities to run crypt algorithms inside.  You could also use HSM as a service product like AWS KMS, which close to modern cloud environment and microservice friendly.

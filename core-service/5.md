### Question

When your service is called, does it require the calling software to authenticate itself, or does it let anything connect?

### Answer

We do need authentication before the client calls any services inside of internet boundary, so this question becomes how to implement this and in different levels.  We could have some client certificate in TLS to allow specified instances to invoke our services or have some network access control policies, but it's hard to manage and far away to application.

Rely a token which supports distribution verification is popular now, in most microservice practice, issue a JWT style access token and pass it from edge service to internal services could make the path safe.  At this time, you could develop a security sidecar to verify the token also have some log and audit, once the token is valid, forward the request to the service and continue the business.  API key is another solution if your client is not end user facing and no relation to specified user, and don't miss the key management and rotation.

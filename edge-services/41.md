### Question

If you assume that your gateway services have been fully breached, what would you do differently elsewhere?

### Answer

If in that case, it should be the highest security incident, you may face the whole system down for a short period and fix the vulnerability as soon as you can.  Some microservices practices recommend to have an API gateway for the services in internal, and implement the business in client side, this is totally wrong if your gateway just forward requests with some load balance strategy, the problem is we couple everything again into the single-point, and the single point is the weakness as the always.

It's hard to answer this question because it's based on the implementation of the gateway service and the upstream, it also depends on the attack method, the service aggregation, the monitor, and the reaction.

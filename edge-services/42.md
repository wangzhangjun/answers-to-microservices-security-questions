### Question

If your gateway services were fully breached, what data could be gleaned from memory?

### Answer

I just reviewed my BFFs and found not only the business data in the memory, except that I think the most valuable data is the secret key.  Basically, if the attacker could access the gateway service and has the administrator role, he could access anything on that machine in different time consumption, although inside the instance we have docker containers, it's just an additional barrier to the attacker. 

You could have obfuscation or sacrifice the performance to avoid variables hold value, the bigger issue is the attacker can do the heap dump.  So the good solution is we should apply 'defense in depth', have multi-layered from infrastructure to software level, set up the access policy to only those who are authorized.

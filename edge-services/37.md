### Question

How do you ensure your internal websites and admin URLs arenâ€™t accidentally opened up to the Internet?

### Answer

Most time the strict ACL for your internal network or VPC could help us to protect something inside (it's common to the cloud environment), often we have some CIDR blocks to define the source and the other rules of the services which need to expose to people in office or though the VPN.  Changing ACL requires admin level permission, but it's static most times and if someone made a mistake and nobody noticed it few days ago, you don't know your internal resources are exposed to wild.

There is a simple solution if you can apply a self-made module in your sidecar, often we force every service must have a nginx reserve proxy in front, and that sidecar supplies functions like access log, proxy and swallow slow connections, so we can check the source from access log and setup alarms, with few LOC.  Although it handles the problem in the question, it's helplessness if someone break into the internal network, keep everything in a boundary and assume that is safe is outdated.

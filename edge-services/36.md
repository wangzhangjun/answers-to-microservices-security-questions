### Question

Who on your staff knows everything about TLS and how to configure it safely?

### Answer

Most people they don't have enough knowledge on TLS or Transport Layer Security, and we don't recommend everyone should be an expert on that.  We should have security expert to arrange a best practice on current implementation, for example in AWS or Azure we could use a lot of build-in security functions, most times we just need review our security requirement and find out which part is missing.

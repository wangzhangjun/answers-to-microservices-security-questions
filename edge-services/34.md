### Question

Have you upgraded your TLS implementations to the latest versions possible?

### Answer

Currently we all know the importance about full path SSL/TLS, it's the best practice to avoid man-in-the-middle, sniffing such attacks.  In microservices, apply TLS in all communications is hard without suitable automatic suite, nobody wants to set the certificate and version for each service, resource by hand, and if your microservices architecture doesn't have a strong consistency, setup TLS on different web container is painful.  It could be worse if you plan to replace the expired certificate or update the TLS version.

TLS 1.3 was defined in RFC 8446 in August 2018, we do need to consider the plan about upgrade.  It's possible to apply the plan when you have a good enough microservice management platform, in our practice, with the as-code infrastructure we just need to update the instance image to latest in code and re-deploy the service.  The core team will provide the new instance image with security update.

You could build some simple application to monitor the TLS, for example create a program open a TLS connection to a server, verify the certificate is going to expire then alarm.  It could be scheduled and running in lambda or container.

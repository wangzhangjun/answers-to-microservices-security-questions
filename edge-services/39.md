### Question

I have a list of cracked passwords and user emails. Could I use your password reminder URL to test which users are in your system?

### Answer

Password reminder is an important feature, but also a target by attackers. Generally speaking, we should avoid to supply function enumeration which help attacker explores the user exist in the system, if user supply wrong password, return "invalid username/password" is better than "wrong password" or "user not found" - we don't want the attacker find out relationship in username, email and password.

We could resolve brute force as the second protection, cause the attacker has list, there will be a lot of requests to your service to check user exists.  You could apply in multiple levels, in CDN, reverse proxy and introduce MFA.

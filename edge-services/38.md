### Question

What information can I get out of the unauthenticated APIs of your gateway services?

### Answer

Design the API is most interesting and important thing during the service development, actually, we are defining the contract about the service which will be exposed to wild.  We want the API clear, easy to understand, maybe RESTful and any clients could access it easily.  Most microservice implementations have API gateway (BTW there are a lot of products), and some companies they are running their own BFF services, and the clients like web browser or mobile, will invoke these edge services via some access token, maybe from SSO identity provider.  That architecture is good, decouples the token issuer and validator, and if the token is invalid, return code 401.

But this question gives us another view about the 401 problems, sometimes we want the service return more information to make the frontend developerâ€™s work easier and we ignore the security risk.  The [OWSAP document here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OWASP-AT-002)) describes what is the vulnerability the attacker could use to enumeration users and start a brute force attack.  In my experience, we prefer to give frontend message to just describe the action result, like `unauthorized` or `invalid token`, the message to the user depends on the client scenarios, for mobile client always tells people you need to login or sign up and this message should be defined in client side.  If the message from your service reveals the credentials, you should be careful.

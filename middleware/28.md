### Question

Do your services have access to all messages in your system, or only the ones they need to see?

### Answer

Of course, you won't do that definitely, we build service in microservice arch always define the domain first, that clarify the border to present the business domain and isolate changes, it's not recommended to let your service access the resources located in the other domain, the other resources are invisible to your service by design.  There is a bad example from my experience, a company uses Kafka to build an ESB to their services, there are more than 1,000 topics on that and each service could subscribe any topic in that ESB, it could be worse because the developer people could access that ESB from the laptop.  The problem is clear if someone breaks the network boundary or some developer loses the credentials, they will lose everything.

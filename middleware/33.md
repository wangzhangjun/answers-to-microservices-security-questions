### Question

How might the legacy systems in your architecture put other services at risk? 

### Answer

There is a story about the legacy system became a security risk in our experience, we have an FTP without secure login and could be accessed from anywhere, 5 years ago people deployed that without any security awareness, and nobody reviewed it for years because of no exception.  For now, I think no one could ensure we don't have a data breach, that because a common FTP server it doesn't have modern audit module or hard to implement it.

This story is a good example to this question, our system won't stop evolution, the legacy part may face the risk after few years, these risks could be found in the modules, the dependencies and some outdated technologies.  It's not possible to have an automatic security review mechanism, but it's nice to have a lot of tools like dependency check to help us avoid part of work.  

So system review or system health check is important in microservices, you may apply these actions periodically for each service, the review could from infrastructure to the application and resources.  Follow up the security team is necessary either, most times the service owner doesn't have enough security knowledge to find out the weakness, and it's better to subscribe some security channels.

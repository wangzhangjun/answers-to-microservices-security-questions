### Question

If youâ€™re protecting your database and messaging with login credentials, how are you protecting the credentials?

### Answer

The program needs credentials to access resources, which often exist as application's configurations, so to keep that in plain text is unacceptable.  There are multiple ways to protect that, encrypt the secret and decrypt that before using is one solution, you need to keep the key in secret and rotation.  AWS KMS is a good choice without any security hardware, when your program starts, invoke AWS KMS to decrypt the secret first.

Another solution is Configuration Service, popular products from Azure and Spring Cloud could store the configuration in cloud, which is easy to integrate with your applications.

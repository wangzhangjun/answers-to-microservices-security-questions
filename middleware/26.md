### Question

Do you share a single messaging middleware login across all your services?

### Answer

This question is similar to question #22, please refer to the previous answer.  In microservices, we prefer to dumb middleware for each service, reduce the security risk is not the most important reason.  Dumb pipes pattern is trying to avoid too much responsibility for a single middleware or ESB, and in our practice, dumb pipes supply isolation in resource level nativly.  That doesn't mean to use the clusters to improve the system's availability.  We recommend to use this pattern if you have enough automatic management methods to monitor.

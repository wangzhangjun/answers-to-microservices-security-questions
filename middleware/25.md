### Question

Do your DB authorisation policies allow updates and deletes to tables that the application only ever inserts into?

### Answer

Least Privilege is the principle to all the developers, it reminds us to request the essential privileges only, and it's also a useful checkpoint in the security review.  A few years ago a developer cleaned up our s3 bucket by a snippet of mindless code, just because we allow all operations to our bucket, it's silly but it will happen.

Database is the most valuable asset in a company, in our world data equals treasure, so that's the reason SQL injection is extremely dangerous.  Like the other risks and vulnerabilities, this problem is not hard to deal, just make sure your application should only be authorized necessary privileges to complete the job, you need to find out the tables, views and the operations you need and update your database privileges.

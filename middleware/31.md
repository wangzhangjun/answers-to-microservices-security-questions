### Question

If an attacker got hold of one serviceâ€™s messaging credentials, what operations could they initiate?

### Answer

This question is similar to question #30, we could consume data or dump some messages as the first step, often after analyzing the message, it's possible to publish message to the middleware in order to control the downstream applications.  We have a queue for the mail sender, obviously the attacker could send SPAMs if the queue is under control, we also have risk of data breach because most messages inside is sensitive.

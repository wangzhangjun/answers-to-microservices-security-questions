### Question

Can your services send messages to any queue, or only where the ones they need to?

### Answer

Definitely don't allow your service to send the message to any queue in your intranet, except the security problem, there will be a lot of common problems come because the shared responsibility, remember the pain which ESB gives to you.

In our practice, we use the two-way binding IAM configurations to ensure the message providers on AWS could have the privilege to push a message to middleware, the configurations define the strict access rules to follow least privilege principle.
